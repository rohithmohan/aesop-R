External Software Needed for AESOP:
-----------------------------------
The following list of software must be installed prior to using the AESOP Framework. SCWRL4 is need for 
non-alanine mutations. The last two programs are needed only for the chimera_images (UCSF Chimera) and 
pdb_align_hom (MUSCLE) utilities, which have been included to aid in the visualization of results and 
in the super-positioning of homologous protein structures. Please visit the links below and follow the 
instructions provided by each website on how to install the programs. Where the programs are installed 
is not of importance, however the path to MUSCLE executable must be added to the PATH environmental 
variable. The paths to all other programs will simply be set in the AESOP scripts. At this time the AESOP 
Framework has only been tested for UNIX platforms (Mac and Linux), since PDB2PQR is unable to installed
on Windows. Those wishing to implement the AESOP framework on a Windows machine will need to use the 
Cygwin environment (http://www.cygwin.com/).
========================================================
R for Statistical Computing - http://www.r-project.org/

Bio3D - http://mccammon.ucsd.edu/~bgrant/bio3d/

APBS - http://www.poissonboltzmann.org/apbs/

PDB2PQR - http://www.poissonboltzmann.org/pdb2pqr/

UCSF Chimera - http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/ (Needed for chimera_images to make isopotential contours)

**MUSCLE - http://www.drive5.com/muscle/ (Needed for pdb_align_hom to select atoms to be used in fitting)

**  Only needed for optional utilities for structure alignment and visualization
========================================================
One additional R package is also needed. It can be installed
by executing the following command while in the R environment:

install.packages("stringr")


Setup and execution of AESOP:
-----------------------------------
After installing the above required software, the paths of these programs must be updated in the AESOP_paths.r
file, which can be found in the source directory. To run an AESOP script, open the R environment and navigate 
to the correct working directory. Finally, the source command is used to execute the the AESOP script. Please 
see the aesop_description.pdf, and the included examples for more details.


***NOTE*** 
To avoid potential problems, it is best to use cleaned PDB files as input, meaning only including ATOM lines.
PDB files do not need to be renumbered, but if multiple chain are present in the PDB file, chain identifiers 
need to be used.
