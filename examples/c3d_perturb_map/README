C3d perturbation map Example
-----------------------
The C3d perturbation map example requires 1 R script (c3d_esi_dist.r), to perform alanine-scan mutagenesis 
and create a spatial distribution of electrostatic similarity (ESI). We have published an analysis similar 
to this example in PLoS Computational Biology:

	Kieslich, C.A. and Morikis, D. (2012) The two sides of complement C3d: Evolution of
	electrostatics in a link between innate and adaptive immunity. PLoS Comp. Bio., 8(12): e1002840.
	
The script should be ran using the R environment. After opening the R environment [simply run the command R in
the terminal] first check the working directory using the command getwd(). Then be sure to navigate to the 
barnase_alascan directory using setwd() [eg. setwd("/Users/ckieslich/aesop-1.0.0/examples/c3d_perturb_map")]. 
The script can be executed using the command source("NAME") [eg. source("c3d_esi_dist.r")].   

(i)   c3d_esi_dist.r  - This script performs the entire analysis, from generating PQR and electrostatic 
potential (DX) files for alanine-scan mutants, as well as generates the ESI distribution (DX file). Only a 
few inputs are needing to run the analysis, and these are:
	
	1) pdb.file  = Name of the parent PDB file ("c3d.pdb") 
	2) cent.on   = Root name of the PDB structure to which all calculations should be centered. This should be the
				   same as the parent structure for alanine-scan analysis ("c3d")

In addition to these inputs other parameters can also be changed if desired, but default parameters are supplied. The
first parameter that may be of interest is the force field (ff argument of ala.scan) that is used in the generation 
of PQR files. The default for AESOP is CHARMM, since this has been optimized for electrostatic calculations. However, 
other force fields such as AMBER and PARSE are available (for more details see: 
http://www.poissonboltzmann.org/pdb2pqr/user-guide/using-pdb2pqr). 

The next set of parameters that should be considered are the input parameters for electrostatic potential calculations
performed by APBS. These parameters can be changed manually by changing the dime, fglen, and cglen in the apbsin.solv 
object. Also, by default the fglen is set to the cglen provided by p, since for clustering it is preferred to have 
the fglen and cglen to be equal. In this AESOP example the parameters are set by the function apbsin.solv(), which uses 
the following default values for APBS keywords:

The ESI used in this example is WD (same as PLoS Bio Ref). The outputs of this script include a directory of PQR files, 
a DX file containing the ESI distribution, and a R binary file (.dat file) containing all of the objects generated in 
this AESOP analysis. The .dat file, and therefore these objects, can be loaded for later use using the R load() function.
The DX file can be visualized as 3D contours or a surface projection using molecular graphics software, such as UCSF Chimera.
