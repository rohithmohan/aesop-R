Barnase-barstar alanine-scan Example
-----------------------
The barnase-barstar alanine-scan example requires 1 R script (barnase_barstar_alascan.r), to perform alanine-scan 
mutagenesis, electrostatic similarity distance (ESD) clustering, and to calculate solvation free energies of 
association. We have published an analysis similar to this example in the Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids:

	Kieslich, C.A., Gorham, R.D., and Morikis, D. (2011) Is the rigid-body assumption reasonable? 
	Insights into the effects of dynamics on the electrostatic analysis of barnase-barstar. 
	J. Non-Cryst. Solids, 357(2): 707-716.
	
The script should be ran using the R environment. After opening the R environment [simply run the command R in
the terminal] first check the working directory using the command getwd(). Then be sure to navigate to the 
barnase_barstar_alascan directory using setwd() [eg. setwd("/Users/ckieslich/aesop-1.0.0/examples/barnase_bartstar_alascan")]. 
The script can be executed using the command source("NAME") [eg. source("bnbs_alascan.r")].   

(i)   bnbs_alascan.r  - This script performs the entire analysis, from generating PQR and electrostatic 
potential (DX) files for alanine-scan mutants, as well as generates the ESD distance 
matrix and performs hierarchical clustering. Only a few inputs are needing to run the analysis, and these are:
	
	1) pdb.name    = Name of the parent PDB file ("barnase_barstar.pdb") 
	2) cent.on     = Root name of the PDB structure to which all calculations should be centered. This should be the
				     same as the parent structure for alanine-scan analysis ("barnase")
	3) chain.names = An array containing the names to be used for each chain, e.g. c("barnase","barstar")

In addition to these inputs other parameters can also be changed if desired, but default parameters are supplied. The
first parameter that may be of interest is the force field (ff argument of batch.pqr) that is used in the generation 
of PQR files. The default for AESOP is CHARMM, since this has been optimized for electrostatic calculations. However, 
other force fields such as AMBER and PARSE are available (for more details see: 
http://www.poissonboltzmann.org/pdb2pqr/user-guide/using-pdb2pqr). 

The next set of parameters that should be considered are the input parameters for electrostatic potential calculations
performed by APBS. These parameters can be changed manually by changing the dime, fglen, and cglen in the apbsin.solv 
object. Also, by default the fglen is set to the cglen, since for clustering it is preferred to have the fglen and cglen 
to be equal. In this AESOP example the parameters are set by the function apbsin.solv(), which uses the following default 
values for APBS keywords:

The ESD used in this example is LD (a.k.a AND). The outputs of this script include directories of PQR files, directories 
of DX files, an image of the ESD dendrogram, and a R binary file (.dat file) containing all of the objects generated in 
this AESOP analysis. This file, and therefore these objects, can be loaded for later use using the R load() function.
